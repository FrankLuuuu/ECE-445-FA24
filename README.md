# 9/8/2024 - First Meeting with Oscar
first meeting, introduction to the project on a whiteboard, gave us the tolerance level, left the main design component to us, introduced the powernode and how the communication protocal will work, gave us the voltage board, answered any questions we had

# 9/9/2024 - In-Person Lab Training
went to the poets lab for the first time and did the in person high voltage training as well as general lab training, learned about lockout/tagout, got the access to the lab after completing an online training and quiz, we can go to the lab whenever to do our work

# 9/28/2024 - Voltage Circuit Explanation
we held a zoom meeting with oscar for him to explain each component of the voltage circuit to us

# 10/9/2024 - DIY Arduino PCB
we learned after our design review that we need to make our own arduino board instead of using an existing one, researched a lot about arduino designs, did a lot of pcb design on all three boards, decided to do three separate boards instead of a big board due to spacing issues

# 10/10/2024 - Power Factor Discussion
we had a meeting with oscar to find some ideas on how to calculate the power factor with our current design, arduino cannot accept ac signal so have to think of snother way to calculate, we were going to use another chip to calculate all power values, or use another circuit, we decided to do everything in software, we found an article that explains how to calculate the power factor using instantaneous and RMS values

# 10/15/2024 - PCB Meeting with Victor
we help a zoom meeting with an expert on pcb that oscar employs to go over some questions we had about the pcb design including the ground and the voltage switching on the voltage board

# 10/24/2024 - PCB Training
we met with oscar at the poets lab for him to give us some hardware could give us inspiration in the design of the powermeter, taught us some basic soldering techniques and solder removal techniques

# 11/1/2024 - SMD Soldering Training


# 11/2/2024 - Arduino Soldering

# 11/3/2024 - Finish Soldering

# 11/4/2024 - Voltage Testing and Redesign

# 11/8/2024 - More Testing
